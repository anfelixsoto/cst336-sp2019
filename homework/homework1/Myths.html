    <h4>
        <u>AI will take over the World</u> <br /> AI does not contain the mind, that we humans have. Most AI right now need human to make it function. AI can beat humans at chess and can run through massive data. It has this, but it is not capable of
        using its mind creatively or show emotional intelligence. The fear will always be there, most of us saw "iRobot". Just always keep in your mind that AI is here to give positive benefits. <br />

                    <u>Job Lose</u> <br /> The goal of using AI is to allow robots and humans to work together, not to replace human. The main goal is to improve conditions in the industries they are put into. This can make work enivornments more efficient.

            <h4>
                <u>Human Characteristics</u> <br /> AI is able to perform almost any job, but it still does not possess human qualities and characteristics. Most AI systems show some kind of emotion, but it is all wired to do so. AI systems do not show
                any compassion, it is just not a natural thing for them. The software running them can only perform certain task. Software Developers can make the AI say certain things, so it not actual feeling. They were just programmed to say that.

            <h4>
                <u>Destruction of Humanity</u> <br /> This what most people think of AIs. That these machine will be the end of the human race, it could happen. But there is a chance that we will lose control of them, but they can ignore us and continue
                to fulfil their purpose. Leading to us possibly creating a relationship with these machines to achieve a peaceful treaty.

            </h4>
            
            <h4>
                <u>Self-Conscious AI</u> <br />
                Having an AI that is self-conscious is pretty diffucult to do. Mostly because we, as humans, do not
                understand how human consciousness works. That alone proves enough that we cannot program an AI to do
                so since we are able to educate ourselves. Maybe in the near future, we will be able to understand and
                maybe figure it out, but as right now. It is not certain to work.
