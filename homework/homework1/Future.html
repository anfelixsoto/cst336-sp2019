                    a bigger and better data base than actually doctor. AI 
                    can quickly research different ways to treat a patient, as

                    With the help of AI, farmers will be able to delivery with higher
                    volumes to help with the growth of the populations. As well as, robots
                    can monitor the health of crops and soil. Having a better understand of 
                    weather patterns to know when it is right to plan current crops. AI can help
                    farmers know when product is ready to be picked to reduce the waste. <br /> <br />

                This is already something that is already out the world. This 
                was introduced a few years ago. The future predicts to have only
                self-driving cars. It will allow for fewer errors, as well as; lower
                the chances of crashes. Also well as, getting rid of all operation
                of human when driving. Allowing to get rid of lights, since the cars
                will be able to communicate with another to make streets more efficent. <br /> <br />
